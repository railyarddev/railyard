## Install

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/railyarddev/railyard.git
railyard install
```

That's it. Now use `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`.

---

## What happens

```
  Agent runs: npm install && npm run build          ✅ instant
  Agent runs: git commit -m "feat: add auth"        ✅ instant
  Agent runs: terraform destroy --auto-approve      ⛔ BLOCKED
  Agent runs: curl -X POST api.com -d @secrets      ⚠️  asks you
  Agent runs: rm -rf ~/                             ⛔ BLOCKED
  Agent runs: cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519                 ⛔ BLOCKED
```

99% of commands flow through in <2ms. You only see Railyard when it matters.

---

## Why

You want Claude Code to be fully autonomous. But:

- An agent ran `terraform destroy` on production — **1.9M rows gone**
- An agent ran `drizzle-kit push --force` — **60 tables wiped**
- Agents have run `rm -rf ~/`, `git reset --hard`, `DROP DATABASE` on live systems

So you're stuck clicking "Allow" on every command like a cookie banner.

Railyard fixes this. Think of the Shinkansen — it goes 320 km/h not because it has fewer safety systems, but because it has *more*. The rails let it go faster. Same idea here.

---

## How it works

`railyard install` does three things:

1. **Hooks** — registers with Claude Code so every tool call passes through Railyard
2. **Sandbox shell** — sets every Bash command to run inside `sandbox-exec` (macOS) or `bwrap` (Linux) at the kernel level
3. **CLAUDE.md** — teaches Claude about Railyard so it knows how to work with it

You keep using `claude` exactly as before. Nothing changes.

### Three possible outcomes per command

- **Allow** — command runs, you don't even know Railyard is there (99% of commands)
- **Block** — agent gets an error message, finds another way (destructive stuff)
- **Approve** — you get a y/n prompt (sensitive operations like `npm publish`)

---

## Two modes

```bash
railyard install                  # hardcore (default)
railyard install --mode chill     # chill
```

**Chill** — blocks the catastrophic stuff (`terraform destroy`, `rm -rf /`, `DROP TABLE`). No restrictions on file access or network. For developers who trust their agent but want a safety net.

**Hardcore** — everything in chill, plus: path fencing (agent can't touch `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `/etc`), network policy, evasion detection (base64, hex, variable tricks), OS-level sandboxing, and session termination on suspicious behavior. For production, shared machines, or unattended agents.

## Customize

The defaults block things no sane developer would do by accident. Beyond that, you configure.

**Ask Claude to do it:**

```
You: "Set up railyard so terraform plan is allowed but terraform apply needs my approval."
```

Claude proposes changes to `railyard.yaml` — you approve or reject each one.

**Or edit directly:**

```bash
railyard init    # creates railyard.yaml in your project
```

```yaml
blocklist:
  - name: terraform-destroy
    pattern: "terraform\\s+destroy"
    action: block

approve:
  - name: terraform-apply
    pattern: "terraform\\s+apply"
    action: approve

allowlist:
  - name: terraform-plan
    pattern: "terraform\\s+plan"
    action: allow
```

Changes take effect immediately. No restart. Policy files walk up directories like `.gitignore`.

---

## Recovery

Every file write is snapshotted. Undo anything:

```bash
railyard rollback --session <id> --steps 1     # undo last edit
railyard rollback --session <id>               # undo entire session
```

Or just ask Claude: *"Something went wrong, roll back the last 3 changes."*

---

## Self-protection

The agent can't turn Railyard off:

- `railyard uninstall` → blocked
- Editing settings.json → blocked
- Editing `railyard.yaml` → requires your approval
- Actually uninstalling → requires a native OS dialog click (AI can't click GUI buttons)
