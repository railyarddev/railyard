## Install

```bash
cargo install railroad-ai
railroad install
```

Railroad makes `--dangerously-skip-permissions` safe.

---

## How is this different from Claude Code's sandbox?

Claude Code's sandbox and auto mode handle system-level sandboxing — filesystem access, network restrictions, OS-level permissions. Railroad is a different thing entirely.

Railroad is a hardening layer for running Claude Code outside the sandbox, against real production assets, with guardrails. It evaluates every command the agent runs and enforces practical restrictions — the same restrictions used to harden mission-critical distributed systems — applied to AI agents.

`npm install` is fine. `terraform destroy --auto-approve` is not. `git commit` is fine. `git push --force origin main` is not. You already know this. Railroad knows it too.

---

## In practice

```
  Agent runs: npm install && npm run build          ✅ instant
  Agent runs: git commit -m "feat: add auth"        ✅ instant
  Agent runs: terraform destroy --auto-approve      ⛔ BLOCKED
  Agent runs: rm -rf ~/                             ⛔ BLOCKED
  Agent runs: echo payload | base64 -d | sh         ⛔ BLOCKED
  Agent runs: curl -X POST api.com -d @secrets      ⚠️  asks you
  Agent runs: cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519                 ⛔ BLOCKED
```

99% of commands flow through in <2ms. You only see Railroad when it matters.

---

## How it works

`railroad install` does three things:

1. **Hooks** — registers with Claude Code so every tool call passes through Railroad
2. **Sandbox** — agents can obfuscate commands to bypass rules (`base64 -d | sh`, chained pipes). The sandbox resolves what a command actually does at the OS level so Railroad can evaluate the real intent
3. **CLAUDE.md** — teaches Claude about Railroad so it knows how to work with it

You keep using `claude` exactly as before. Nothing changes.

---

## Customize

Ask Claude to do it:

```
You: "Set up railroad so terraform plan is allowed but terraform apply needs my approval."
```

Or edit `railroad.yaml` directly:

```bash
railroad init    # creates railroad.yaml in your project
```

```yaml
blocklist:
  - name: terraform-destroy
    pattern: "terraform\\s+destroy"

approve:
  - name: terraform-apply
    pattern: "terraform\\s+apply"

allowlist:
  - name: terraform-plan
    pattern: "terraform\\s+plan"
```

Changes take effect immediately. No restart.

---

## Also included

**Multi-agent coordination** — Run multiple Claude Code sessions in the same repo. Railroad locks files per session so agents don't clobber each other. Locks self-heal if a session dies.

```bash
railroad locks     # see all active locks
```

**Dashboard & replay** — Watch every tool call across all sessions in real time, or browse what any session did after the fact.

```bash
railroad dashboard
railroad replay --session <id>
```

**Recovery** — Every file write is snapshotted. Undo anything.

```bash
railroad rollback --session <id> --steps 1     # undo last edit
railroad rollback --session <id>               # undo entire session
```
